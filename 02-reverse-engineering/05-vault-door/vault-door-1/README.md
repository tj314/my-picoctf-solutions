# Reverse engineering: vault-door-1

This vault uses some complicated arrays! I hope you can make sense of it, special agent. The source code for this vault is here:Â [VaultDoor1.java](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/ff2585f7afd21b81f69d2fbe37c081ae/VaultDoor1.java)

## Solution

The password is checked character by character. I siomply had to arrange the characters in the correct order using pen and paper. The flag was **picoCTF{d35cr4mbl3_tH3_cH4r4cT3r5_75092e}**.

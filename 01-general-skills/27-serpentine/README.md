# General skills: Serpentine
Find the flag in the Python script!
[Download Python script](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/93/serpentine.py)

## Solution
I downloaded the script and read it. It contained a function called `print_flag`, but it was never called, so I called it from main and ran the script. This produced the flag.

# General skills: convertme.py
Run the Python script and convert the given number from decimal to binary to get the flag.
[Download Python script](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/31/convertme.py)

## Solution
Get the script using wget. The script generates a random number and asks you to enter its binary representation. I did not bother to do that. I simply modified the source code to always decrypt the flag :)

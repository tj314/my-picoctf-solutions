# General skills: Codebook
Run the Python script code.py in the same directory as codebook.txt.
- [Download code.py](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/102/code.py)
- [Download codebook.txt](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/102/codebook.txt)

## Solution
Get the files and the flag:
```bash
$ wget "https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/102/code.py"
$ wget "https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/102/codebook.txt"
$ python code.py
```

I have no idea, what the point of this exercise was.

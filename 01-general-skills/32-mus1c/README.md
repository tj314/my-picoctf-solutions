# General skills: mus1c
I wrote you a [song](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/c0863a3b0170d6dd176be3a595b4b75e/lyrics.txt). Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.

## Solution
Unfortunately for the creator of this challenge, I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U) talk some time back. I felt like a rockstar after that. As for this challenge, [here](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) is all I needed.

I executed the song and the following output was produced:
```
114
114
114
111
99
107
110
114
110
48
49
49
51
114
```
I converted these values to chars and got the flag.
